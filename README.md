# KaiyeYang-git-Sentimental-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-on-Twitter-about-Car-Purchase-UK
The main purpose of study to compare the contents of interactions of UK twitter user who mentioned about cars in pre-covid and post-covid time through machine learning. Twofold experiments are designed for analysing their interactions in terms of their attitudes and the focus on car attributes. To further understand what British people need when they want to buy a car during the pandemic, the first experiment will concentrate on breaking their comments into small pieces at first, and then extract the most frequent word or word chunks (or in the other rules) for having a brief look about what they valued most. Then comparison among the results of 2019 and 2021 (or just many result comparisons based on quarter happened within these three years) will show the tendency of targeted participants’ attitude change. Then it is important to validate that whether the pandemic have influenced customer’s preference on car purchase, or any other incidents (away from covid) has influenced viewers’ opinions, or just the car own attributes changed their mind. Therefore, the second experiment is to use word embedding techniques and dictionaries of attitudinal words for analysing the comment preference in either positive or negative tunes. Systematic sampling is applied that collects the comment information under an equal interval time route to ensure unbiased sample distribution.  Some dates that something important happened will be also recorded for analysing whether their attitudes will be changed by short-term incidents (like interest raising, Ukraine war, e-power compensations, and lockdown…). Also, the demographical information of twitter user can be considered as variables, like gender, location reflected from ID, and the way of sharing opinions (tweet or retweet).
